# Fitting OSSL models

[<img src="./img/soilspec4gg-logo_fc.png" alt="SoilSpec4GG logo" width="250"/>](https://soilspectroscopy.org/)

This is the repository for all model calibration development for the [Soil Spectroscopy for Global
Good](https://soilspectroscopy.org) project and based on the [Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL)](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/) database.

We have used the [MLR3 framework](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/) for fitting machine learning models, specifically with the [Cubist algorithm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Cubist/vignettes/cubist.html).

The `README` of folder [`R-mlr`](R-mlr/README.md) explains the steps used to calibrate the models, while this page provides an overview of the modeling and results.

In summary, we have provided 5 different model types depending on the availability of samples in the database, without the use of geocovariates (`na` code), i.e., site information or environmental layers are not used, only the spectra data.

The model types are composed of two different subsets, i.e. using the KSSL soil spectral library alone (`kssl` code) or the full OSSL database (`ossl` code), in combination with three spectral types: VisNIR (`visnir` code), NIR from the Neospectra instrument (`nir.neospectra` code), and MIR (`mir` code).

After running some internal evaluations, we recommend using the KSSL models only when i) there is not any model available using the full OSSL database for a given combination of soil property and spectral region of interest; ii) the spectra to be predicted has the same instrument manufacturer/model as the spectrometers used to build the KSSL VisNIR and MIR libraries; iii) the KSSL library is representative for the new spectra, based both on spectral similarity and range of soil properties of interest of the target samples. **Otherwise, use the models with `ossl` acronym**.

The machine learning algorithm Cubist (coding name `cubist`) takes advantage of a decision-tree splitting method but fits linear regression models at each terminal leaf. It also uses a boosting mechanism (sequential trees adjusted by weights) that allows the growth of a forest by tuning the number of committees. We haven't used the correction of final predictions by the nearest neighbors' influence due to the lack of this feature in the MLR3 framework.

Hyperparameter optimization was done with internal resampling (`inner`) using 5-fold cross-validation and a smaller subset for speeding up this operation. This task was performed with a grid search of the hyperparameter space testing up to 5 configurations to find the lowest RMSE. The final model with the best optimal hyperparameters was fitted at the end with the full train data.

As predictors, we have used the first 120 PCs of the compressed spectra, a threshold that considers the trade-off between spectral representation and compression magnitude. The remaining farther components were used for the trustworthiness test, i.e., if a sample is underrepresented in respect of the feature space from the calibration set because of their unique features presented in those farther components, then a flag is raised and indicated in the results.

Soil properties with available models can be found in [fitted_modeling_combinations_v1.2.csv](out/fitted_modeling_combinations_v1.2.csv).

Final evaluation was performed with external (`outer`) 10-fold cross validation of the tuned models using root mean square error (`rmse`), mean error (`bias`), R squared (`rsq`), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (`ccc`), and the ratio of performance to the interquartile range (`rpiq`).

The cross-validated predictions were used to estimate the unbiased error (absolute residual), which were further employed to calibrate uncertainty models via [conformal prediction intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction). The error model is calibrated using the same fine-tuned structure of the respective response model. Conformity scores are estimated for a defined confidence level, which was defined to 68% to approximate one standard deviation.

Some soil properties were natural-log transformed (with offset = 1, that is why we use `log1p` function) to improve the prediction performance of highly skewed distributed soil properties. They were back-transformed only at the end after running all modeling steps, including performance estimation and the definition of the uncertainty intervals.

The final fitted models along with their performance metrics can be found in
[fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv](out/fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv)

Validation plots are available in the [`out/plots`](out/plots) folder.

# OSSL Engine

The OSSL Engine is a web platform where the user can upload spectra from the VisNIR (400-2500 nm), NIR (1350-2550 nm), or MIR (600-4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>) ranges and get predictions back with uncertainty estimation and the representativeness flag.

Please, check the example datasets for formatting your spectra to the minimum required level. You can provide either csv files or directly asd or opus (.0) for VisNIR and MIR scans, respectively.

We recommend using the OSSL model type when getting predictions. KSSL is recommended when the spectra to be predicted have the same instrument manufacturer/model as the KSSL library and are represented by the range of soil properties of interest. Otherwise, use the OSSL subset.

# Using OSSL models on your computer

To load the complete analysis-ready models, training data, cross-validated predictions, validation performance metrics, and validation plots in R, please download them to the same directory structure as specified in [fitted_models_access.csv](out/fitted_models_access.csv).

Script **[script_04f_download_ossl_models.R](R-mlr/script_04f_download_ossl_models.R)** describes the automated steps to grab all the required files to your computer.

`qs` is a serialized and compressed file format that is faster than native R `rds`. You need to have [qs package](https://github.com/traversc/qs) version >= 0.25.5 to load files direct from the URLs.

> NOTE: For using the trained models on new spectra, the spectra must have the [same range](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/neospectra-database.html#database-description) of the OSSL models, i.e. 400-2500 nm for VisNIR, 600-4000 cm<sup>-1</sup> for MIR, and 1350-2550 for NIR (Neospectra)..

We provided in this repository both [examples of datasets](sample-data) and a [prediction function](R-mlr/OSSL_functions.R) that preprocess and provide all outputs.

Please, check the example datasets for formatting your spectra to the minimum required level of the prediction function. You can provide either `csv` files or directly `asd` or opus (`.0`) for VisNIR and MIR scans, respectively.

The results table has the prediction value (already back-transformed if log transformation was used) for the soil property of interest, standard deviation and uncertainty band, and a flag column for **potential underrepresented** samples given the OSSL calibration data, which is calculated based on principal components and Q statistics.

The prediction function requires the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [mlr3](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/intro.html), [qs](https://github.com/traversc/qs), [asdreader](https://github.com/pierreroudier/asdreader), [opusreader2](https://github.com/spectral-cockpit/opusreader2), and [matrixStats](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/matrixStats/index.html) packages.

Parameters:  

- `target`: the soil property of interest. Log-transformed properties must have `log..` appended at the beginning of the name as indicated in the `export_name` column.  
- `spectra.file`: the path for the spectral measurements, either a `csv` table (following the sample-data specifications), `asd`, or opus (`.0`) file.  
- `spectra.type`: the spectral range of interest. Either `visnir`, `nir.neospectra`, or `mir`.  
- `subset.type`: the subset of interest, either the whole `ossl` or the `kssl` alone.  
- `geo.type`: only available for `na`.  
- `models.dir`: the path for the `ossl_models` folder. Should follow the same structure and naming code as represented in [fitted_models_access.csv](out/fitted_models_access.csv).

All files that represent the **ossl_models** directory tree for local run or online access are described in [ossl_models_directory_tree.csv](out/ossl_models_directory_tree.csv).

> Please note that the soil properties indication follows the export name. Check [fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv](out/fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv) for the complete list of models of each soil property as some spectral types may not be available. More importantly, for natural-log soil properties, the upper and lower bands were estimated before the back-transformation.
