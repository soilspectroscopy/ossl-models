# Fitting OSSL models

[<img src="./img/soilspec4gg-logo_fc.png" alt="SoilSpec4GG logo" width="250"/>](https://soilspectroscopy.org/)

This is the repository for all model calibration development for the [Soil Spectroscopy for Global
Good](https://soilspectroscopy.org) project and based on the [Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL)](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/) database.

We have used the [MLR3 framework](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/) for fitting machine learning ensemble models.

The `README` of folder [`R-mlr`](R-mlr/README.md) explains the steps used to calibrate the models used in the OSSL.

In summary, we have provided 5 different model types depending on the availability of samples in the database, without the use of geocovariates (`na` code) as predictors.

The model types are composed of two different subsets, i.e. using the KSSL soil spectral library alone (`kssl` code) or the full OSSL database (`ossl` code), in combination with three spectral types: VisNIR (`visnir` code), NIR from the Neospectra instrument (`nir.neospectra` code), and MIR (`mir` code).

```{r model_types, echo=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("out/modeling_combinations_v1.2.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  dplyr::distinct(spectra_type, subset, geo, model_name) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

The ensemble model (coding name `mlr3..eml`) is composed of a linear regression (meta-learner, `regr.lm`) of base learners.

Base learners were fitted using Elastic net (`glmnet`), Random Forest (`ranger`), XGBoost trees (`xgboost`), and Cubist (`cubist`).

MLR3 allows the base learners to feed the meta-learner with cross-validated (`cv`) or plain calibration predictions (`insample`), but we used `insample` to speed up processing.

Hyperparameter optimization was done with internal resampling (`inner`) using 5-fold cross-validation and a smaller subset for speeding up this operation. This task was performed with a random search of the hyperparameter space testing up to 20 configurations to find the lowest RMSE. The final model with the best optimal hyperparameters was fitted at the end with the full train data.

The search space was composed of crossed combinations, i.e. each model is not individually tuned. Check [`R-mlr/README.md`](R-mlr/README.md) for more details.

As predictors, we have use the first 120 PCs of the compressed spectra, a threshold that considers the tradeoff between spectral representation and compression magnitude.

The following soil properties have models fitted:
```{r soil_properties, echo=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("out/fitted_modeling_combinations_v1.2.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  dplyr::distinct(soil_property, description, export_name) |>
  dplyr::mutate(unit_transform = export_name) |>
  dplyr::mutate(unit_transform = ifelse(grepl("log..", unit_transform), "log1p", "original")) |>
  dplyr::select(soil_property, description, unit_transform, export_name) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Final evaluation was performed with external (`outer`) 10-fold cross validation of the tuned models using root mean square error (`rmse`), mean error (`bias`), R squared (`rsq`), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (`ccc`), and ratio of performance to the interquartile range (`rpiq`).

Validation plots are available in the [`out/plots`](out/plots) folder.

The final fitted models description along with their performance can be found in
[out/fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv](out/fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv)

# Using OSSL models on your computer

To load the complete analysis-ready models, train data, cross-validated predictions, validation performance metrics, and validation plot in R, please use the public URLs described in [out/fitted_models_access.csv](out/fitted_models_access.csv)

`qs` is a serialized and compressed file format that is faster than native R `rds`. You need to have [qs package](https://github.com/traversc/qs) version >= 0.25.5 to load files direct from the URLs.

> NOTE: For using the trained models with new spectra, the PC scores should be predicted from the [Standard Normal Variate (SNV) preprocessed](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prospectr/vignettes/prospectr.html#scatter-and-baseline-corrections) spectra following the [same specifications and nomenclature](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/neospectra-database.html#database-description) of the OSSL database (in the previous example we used the `nir.neospectra` model).  

We provided a prediction in this repository both [examples of datasets](sample-data) and a [prediction function](R-mlr/OSSL_functions.R) that incorporates all of these operations.

Please, check the example datasets for formatting your dataset to the minimum level required for the prediction function. You can provide either `csv` files or directly `asd` or opus (`.0`) for VisNIR and MIR scans, respectively.

With it, the user can get table results for the soil property of interest (with confidence interval) and a flag (spectral_outlier) which screens a **potential spectral misrepresentation**.

The prediction functions requires the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [mlr3](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/intro.html), [qs](https://github.com/traversc/qs), [asdreader](https://github.com/pierreroudier/asdreader), [opusreader2](https://github.com/spectral-cockpit/opusreader2), and [matrixStats](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/matrixStats/index.html) packages.

Parameters:  

- `target`: the soil property of interest. Log-transformed properties must have `log..` appended at the beginning of the name as indicated in the `export_name` column.  
- `spectra.file`: the path for the spectral measurements, either a `csv` table (following the sample-data specifications), `asd`, or opus (`.0`) file.  
- `spectra.type`: the spectral range of interest. Either `visnir`, `nir.neospectra`, or `mir`.  
- `subset.type`: the subset of interest, either the whole `ossl` or the `kssl` alone.  
- `geo.type`: only available for `na`.  
- `models.dir`: the path for the `ossl_models` folder. Should follow the same structure and naming code as represented in [out/fitted_models_access.csv](out/fitted_models_access.csv).

> Please note that the soil properties indication follows the export name. In addition, check [out/fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv](out/fitted_models_performance_v1.2.csv) for the complete list of models of each soil property as some spectra types are not completely available.
